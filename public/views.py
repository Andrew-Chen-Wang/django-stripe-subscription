What does stripe handle? Stripe's webhooks will send a bunch of information
that you have signed up for in the Stripe Developer/Webhook section.
That can be found here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks when you are logged-in

Follow the README closely in order for this to work. Obviously, these are just the base methods
that you will need to expand on for your usage.
