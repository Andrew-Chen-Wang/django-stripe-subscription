"""
What does stripe handle? Stripe's webhooks will send a bunch of information
that you have signed up for in the Stripe Developer/Webhook section.
That can be found here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks when you are logged-in

Follow the README closely in order for this to work. Obviously, these are just the base methods
that you will need to expand on for your usage.

    Mostly modeled after Stripe's Flask app. Flask is a minimal Django and very similar, so it's easy to read:
    https://github.com/stripe-samples/checkout-single-subscription/blob/master/client-and-server/server/python/server.py

    You also need to setup the stripe-cli since this setup uses Server+Client integration of Stripe.
    https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli
    Simply skip Step 3.
    Note: responses from your server are not returned to Stripe and wonâ€™t show up in the Dashboard.

    This view also verifies that it's Stripe sending us the webhook.

    Make sure you have the stripe package installed (should be in requirements.txt)
